## Please Note

As I completed only around 60% of the givin tasks during the test (due to time/speed issues and not lack of knowledge), I thought I'd come back to it later after work and finish it because I honestly hate unfinished work and so you could see what it would look like if I had a little bit more time on the clock.

<ul>
  <li>So If you would like to view the whole project up until this point, feel free to check out the last commit <i>"deploying v1.2"</i><strong> (around 2.5h - 3h spent on total </strong>). </li>
